# Parts preparing
Ensure the printed parts are printed without any warping to ensure proper and perfectly aligned components during installation.

Pls do a test print on a small part for fitting and tolerance measurement before commiting to the full printed parts.


# Carriage
Current carriage is for VZBot. You may need to adapt the carriage to suit yr printer


# Toolhead
Toolheads doesn't have any part cooling fan. You will only need 1 5015 part cooling fan on the carriage instead.
The part cooling duct is fixed height, therfore you will need to have the same height hotends across all toolheads. 


# Docks

3. Docks (1 dock per toolhead required)
