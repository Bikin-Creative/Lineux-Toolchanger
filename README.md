# Description
Lineux Toolchanger consist of a suite of 3 parts:
1. Lineux - The hardware consisting of the Carriage, Toolhead and Dock
2. Btc - The macros handling the toolchange
3. Dockslide - Stowable dock to maximise print build

All 3 parts can be used with other systems. Example, Lineux can be used with other toolchanger plugin. Other toolchanger hardware can use Btc macros. Etc...

Lineux has evolved into a front mounted Toolchanger with Dockslide as our primary configuration.
If you intend to use a fixed dock configuration, pls do check or ask in discord if there are any mods or alternatives that may have already been released.

(Design, hardwares and configuration may change. Do check with us on discord)

## Cost
Aside from costs at BOM, you will need these items. These are not included in the BOM
1. PSU. You will need 120W power for every tool. 6 tools will need 720W
2. Toolboard. Every tool will need 1 toolboard, eg [Fysetc H36](https://www.fysetc.com/cdn/shop/files/1_7592a53e-6f52-4a15-aeb8-11dbfa196516.jpg?v=1744444741)
3. Extruder. Every tool will need 1 extruder
4. Hotend. Every tool will need 1 hotend, eg [E3D Revo Voron](https://e3d-online.com/), [Trianglelab CHC](https://trianglelab.net/)
5. PDB. Although not really required, we recommend you to have a Power Distribution Board to provide connections/power to the toolboards, eg [Fysetc Tool Distribution Board](https://www.fysetc.com/cdn/shop/files/a3c4612ef030bc35ada3147286ebf6aa_b0e6d879-f14f-4daf-94f8-5ec51c08036b.jpg?v=1739847175)

# Printers
This project was developed on a Vzbot 330 and Voron 2.4. Other printers would need slight modifications. We could add support for other printers when there are others who had modded successfully, or when
we are able to get a hold of other printers to mod.
