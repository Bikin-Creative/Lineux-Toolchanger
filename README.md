# Marhaen
Lineux Marhaen is just a mod of the Lineux Toolchanger. Since starting the Lineux project, I've always envisioned running Lineux off a single toolboard and extruder motor. I finally had time to start this off. This mod shall be called Lineux Marhaen

# Why
A single toolboard and motor makes the build very much cheaper, and very much lighter. Cheaper and lighter is always better

# Development
Development is on my frankenstein Voron 2.4
