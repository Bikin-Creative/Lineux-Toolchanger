# Umbilical Management
Included in the CAD are Umbilical Hub (UmbiHub) mounts for 5-tool and 6-tool configurations.

The Nexus Box is designed to house toolhead distribution boards and supports either two [BTT CEB boards](https://github.com/bigtreetech/CEB)
or one [Fysetc Tool Distribution Board](https://github.com/FYSETC/Tool-Distribution-Board)<br/><br/>

This will enable cleaner wirings for your umbilicals from your toolheads to your MCU.<br/><br/><br/>
