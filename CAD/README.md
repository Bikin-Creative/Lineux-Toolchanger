# Overview

There are 2 toolhead systems currently available:

- **LineuxDB** - based on DragonBurner with partcooling fan embedded into the toolhead
- **Lineux One** - Is a lighter, smaller toolhead. The partcooling fan is mounted on the carriage and is shared across all toolheads.

Current development is focused primarily on Lineux One.

*Note:* the toolheads use different carriage systems and are not compatible with each other. 

# Dockslide
Dockslide is an optional addon to recover back any build volume loss encountered when having a fixed dock location on the existing printer.

# Requirement
1. Carriage
2. Toolheads (Quantity depends on how many you require or may fit on your printer. Minimum of 2 toolheads recomended)
3. Docks (1 dock per toolhead required)

**Highly recommended:**
4. Nudge probe (Needed for tool nozzle offset calibration)
