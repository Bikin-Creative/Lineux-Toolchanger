# Overview

## Lineux One
All cads released are based on a Voron_2.4 and Vzbot. You might need to adapt the dock and carriage to yr own printers. You can also check usermods section for any other printers cad/stl that may have been contributed by the community if they are not available here. Pls also do check in discord for any mods/contributions by the community.

Designs, mechanism and bom do get updated as we progress. Do take note.

# Printed Parts
Ensure the printed parts are printed without any warping to ensure proper and perfectly aligned components during installation.

It is recommended to do a test print on a small part for fitting, material shrinkage and tolerance measurement before commiting to the full printed parts.

Recommended slicer settings are as follows (Props to Voron team):
```
Layer height: 0.2mm
Extrusion width: 0.4mm, forced
Infill pecentage: 40%
Infill type: Adaptive Cubic, grid, gyroid, honeycomb, triangle, or cubic
Wall count: 4
Solid top/bottom layers: 5
```

# Carriage
Refer to the printer carriage available or check under usermods section. Pls do check in discord as well.

# Toolhead
Lineux One Toolheads doesn't have any part cooling fan. You will only need 1 5015 part cooling fan on the carriage instead.
The part cooling duct is fixed height, therefore you will need to have the same height hotends across all toolheads. 

# Docks
Simple docking system.

# Dockslide
Dockslide is an optional addon to recover back any build volume loss encountered when having a fixed dock on the existing printer in which the frame wasn't extended in X or Y.

# Requirement
1. Carriage
2. Toolheads (Quantity depends on how many you require or may fit on yr printer. Minimum of 2 toolheads recomended)
3. Docks (1 dock per toolhead required)
4. Tubby (Required for tool nozzle offset calibration)
