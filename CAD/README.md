# Overview

There are 2 toolhead systems currently available:

- [**LineuxDB**](https://github.com/Bikin-Creative/Lineux-Toolchanger/tree/main/CAD/LineuxDB) - based on DragonBurner with partcooling fan embedded into the toolhead
- [**Lineux One**](https://github.com/Bikin-Creative/Lineux-Toolchanger/tree/readme_v2/CAD/LineuxOne) - Is a lighter, smaller toolhead. The partcooling fan is mounted on the carriage and is shared across all toolheads.

Current development is focused primarily on **Lineux One**.

*Note:* the toolheads use different carriage systems and are not compatible with each other. 

# Dockslide
Dockslide is an optional addon to recover back any build volume loss encountered when having a fixed dock location on the existing printer.
It's a system that moves the dock bar up and down during the tool changes allowing the idle toolheads to move out of the way of the print bed.


# Requirement
1. Carriage
2. Toolheads (Quantity depends on how many you require or may fit on your printer. Minimum of 2 toolheads recomended)
3. Docks (1 dock per toolhead required)

**Highly recommended:**
4. Nudge probe (Needed for tool nozzle offset calibration)
