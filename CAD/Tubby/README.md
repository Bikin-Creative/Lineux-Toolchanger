# Overview

Tubby is a nozzle offset calibration tool designed with minimal hardware and simplicity in mind. Several variations of Tubby are available, allowing you to choose the version that best suits your requirements.

If the magnet used is not strong enough to securely hold the floating version of Tubby on the print bed, you may opt for the larger magnet base for improved stability.
