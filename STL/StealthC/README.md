# Lineux Stealth CNC (StealthC)
StealthC is a CNC-machined Carrier and Lock Plate designed for Lineux. The available carriage mounting options are listed below.

For the Fysetc Voron CNC Tap, the existing tap MGN plate is removed and replaced directly with the StealthC Carrier and Lock Plate, as illustrated. No belt removal is required, making the adaptation of Lineux StealthC a straightforward and simple process.
