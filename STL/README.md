# Overview

# Printed Parts
Ensure the printed parts are printed without any warping to ensure proper and perfectly aligned components during installation.

It is recommended to do a test print on a small part for fitting, material shrinkage and tolerance measurement before commiting to the full printed parts.

Recommended slicer settings are as follows (Props to Voron team):
```
Layer height: 0.2mm
Extrusion width: 0.4mm, forced
Infill pecentage: 40%
Infill type: Adaptive Cubic, grid, gyroid, honeycomb, triangle, or cubic
Wall count: 4
Solid top/bottom layers: 5
```



# Printing Orientation
Normal auto rotate will work for all parts for proper printing orientation. 
These listed parts below however is recommended to be forced in the displayed printing orientation
