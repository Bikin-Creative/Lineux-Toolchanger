# Docks
The base Lineux design uses Dockslide, which provides the most optimized setup for running Lineux on your printer.

If you are using Dockslide, you will need the R2T dock files.
If you are not using Dockslide and instead are mounting the docks directly to the printer frame, you will need to use the fixed dock files that match your specific printer carriage.

All other toolhead docks will be in their respective toolhead folder.
