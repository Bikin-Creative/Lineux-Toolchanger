# Overview
Bikin Toolchanger is using pure macros. It uses snippets of codes from the [Magswitch](https://github.com/jera-sea/MagSwitch-Toolchanger) project and the
[Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe).

# Nudge Tool
Nudge tool was created by [zruncho](https://github.com/zruncho3d/nudge). It provides a very accurate and convenient way to align nozzles for toolchangers.
Btc provided macros to utilize the tool for nozzle alignment. Instructions for use are [here](https://github.com/Bikin-Creative/Lineux-Toolchanger/blob/main/Manual/NUDGE.md).
